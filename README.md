## About

Koemi is a note-taking app I’ve been working on for myself. I like Markdown because it’s straightforward and easy to read, similar to how Obsidian handles things. I wanted a way to keep track of my thoughts and memories, so I set it up to upload everything to a vector database. That lets an AI pull stuff up later, and I can switch between a local model, Anthropic, or OpenAI depending on what I need.

One feature I’ve added is the ability to open a note and chat with the AI right at the bottom. The conversation doesn’t save, which keeps it simple, but I can summarize the key points and add them to the note. The AI can also search my other notes and link relevant bits, which helps me see connections.

I’ve included an open-source voice assistant with custom prompts, so it can adapt to different vibes—playful or focused, whatever fits. The dashboard has small prompts to revisit old notes or start new ones, which keeps things moving without being pushy.

This isn’t about selling or fitting a niche. As a designer, I’m building Koemi for myself—a practical tool that mixes my notes with AI in a way that feels useful and personal. I’m enjoying the process of making it work just how I want it.
