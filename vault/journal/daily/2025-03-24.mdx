###  Why Do Cats Stare?

My cat’s been watching me all day. Not blinking, just… staring. I was eating cereal, and there she was, perched on the counter, eyes like little green lasers. I asked her what she wanted—food? attention?—but she just flicked her tail and kept staring. It’s unsettling, like she’s judging my life choices. Maybe she knows something I don’t. Or maybe she’s just plotting to knock my phone off the table aga*in. Eithe*r way, I’m sleeping with one eye open tonight.
