## The Art of Cloud Watching

Today, I lay on the grass and stared at the sky for an hour. The clouds were doing their slow dance—puffy ones morphing into dragons, then dissolving into wisps that looked like feathers. I wondered how many people still take the time to do this. It’s free, it’s quiet, and it’s oddly satisfying. My favorite was a blob that briefly resembled a lopsided whale before the wind stretched it into nothing. Maybe tomorrow I’ll bring a sketchbook and try to capture them before they disappear.
